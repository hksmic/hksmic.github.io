        <h3><b>Empowering teacher agency in the era of Artificial Intelligence: challenges and strategies</b></h3>
        <h4>Presented by Professor Xibin Han </b></h4>
    </div>
</br>
         <p style="color: rgb(81, 80, 80);"><b>Abstract.</b> This study explores teacher agency and strategies for extending teacher agency to meet the challenges brought about by the rapid Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements. It adopts the concept of teacher agency, rather than competency for teachers, to explore the complexities of teacher professional development. It builds upon the growing body of research that explores teacher agency through a systems approach, emphasizing the interdependent, interactive and evolving nature of teacher agency. Using the UNESCO’s AI competency framework as a foundation, this research investigates the current state of AI-empowered teaching practices in vocational colleges and schools in China. By analyzing empirical data from a survey, it provides insights into how teachers engage with AI technologies at different agency levels—ranging from basic adoption to pedagogical innovation and leadership in shaping AI-empowered education. The study underscores the importance of a human-centered mindset to AI in education, an approach which ensures that teachers retain agency while leveraging AI to innovate student learning experience and teachers’ life-long professional development. Based on its findings, the study proposes strategies for expanding teacher agency at various stages of growth. These include equipping educators with AI knowledge and application skills, fostering awareness of the ethical and sociocultural implications of AI, deepening pedagogical strategies for meaningful AI integration, and promoting continuous professional development through AI-powered tools.</p>

        <h3><b>Integrating Generative AI into Research-Based Learning for Undergraduate Students: Perceptions, Adoption Drivers, and Its Impact on Research Performance</b></h3>
        <h4>Presented by Professor Achmad Nizar Hidayanto </b></h4>
    </div>
</br>
         <p style="color: rgb(81, 80, 80);"><b>Abstract.</b> Higher education in Indonesia is facing the challenge of producing graduates who are not only academically competent but also equipped with practical skills relevant to the demands of Industry 4.0. To address this, student-centered learning has been promoted to enhance 21st-century skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving. In this context, Generative AI presents a promising tool to support learning and research activities, helping students design survey instruments, analyze data, and structure research reports more efficiently. Despite growing interest in the technical and pedagogical aspects of Generative AI, few studies have examined its impact on students' quantitative research skills and research self-efficacy. This study integrates Generative AI into research-based learning within an Applied Statistics course, implementing the 5E Learning Model (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate) with ChatGPT as a learning aid. Using the DeLone & McLean model, Technology Acceptance Model, and Rational Choice Theory, this research explores students’ perceptions, adoption drivers, and the perceived impact of Generative AI on research performance.

            Data collected from 219 undergraduate students indicate that perceived usefulness, ease of use, and satisfaction significantly influence students’ intention to adopt Generative AI, while perceived risk and learning cost do not. Moreover, Generative AI usage contributes positively to students’ research performance, including improved output quality, enhanced research skills, greater self-confidence, and a stronger intention to undertake a research project for graduation. These findings not only enrich the literature on educational technology adoption but also offer practical insights for integrating Generative AI into higher education curricula to support digital transformation in learning</p>

        <h3><b>The 3D-POD Model for AI-Driven Institutional Transformation and Graduate Employment Readiness in Thailand in Digital Era</b></h3>
        <h4>Presented by Dr Sirinuch Sararuch </h4>
    </div>
    </br>
         <p><b>Abstract.</b> As Thailand navigates the challenges of the digital economy, higher education institutions are increasingly compelled to undertake systemic transformation to prepare graduates for employment in AI-integrated environments. This study proposes an AI-driven institutional transformation model specifically tailored to the context of Thai universities. The study was conducted with three primary objectives: (1) to synthesize the core components of the model, (2) to develop and validate the proposed framework, and (3) to assess its practical applicability. A mixed methods research (MMR) design was adopted to ensure conceptual rigor and contextual relevance. The research procedure comprised three phases: (1) model synthesis, (2) model validation, and (3) model evaluation. The findings revealed that the developed model, referred to as the 3D-POD Model, encompasses three integrated dimensions of transformation: 1) The vertical axis comprises five strategic domains—People, Pedagogy, Process, Platform, and Pathway; 2) The horizontal axis outlines five operational phases—Origin, Operation, Output, Outcome, and Optimization; 3) The depth axis defines five levels of digital maturity—Digital Passive, Digitization, Digitalization, Digital Transition, and Digital Transformation. Collectively, these dimensions form a structured matrix (5 Strategic × 5 Operational × 5 Maturity Levels) that provides a practical lens for planning, implementing, and assessing AI-enhanced transformation in higher education. Quantitative validation confirmed the model’s high content validity and practical applicability, offering a strategic roadmap for AI-enhanced transformation and graduate employability in Thai higher education. The 3D-POD model serves as a strategic roadmap to support institutional transformation and improve graduate employability in Thailand’s AI-driven educational landscape.</p>

        <h3><b>Redefining Language Course Design: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Enhanced Learning and Assessment in Higher Education</b></h3>
        <h4>Presented by Professor Di Zou </h4>
    </div>
    </br>
         <p><b>Abstract.</b> This talk examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on language course design, highlighting both challenges and opportunities. I begin by addressing educators’ growing concerns about students’ potential misuse of AI in academic assignments, which has led to a shift towards more cognitively demanding assessment formats. These redesigned assessments encourage critical engagement with course materials, ensuring that students actively construct knowledge rather than passively relying on AI-generated responses.

            Next, I explore the integration of AI in feedback mechanisms, demonstrating how AI-driven feedback can streamline teachers’ workload while improving the quality, consistency, and timeliness of feedback on students’ writing and speaking. I discuss the synergy between teacher feedback, peer feedback, and AI-generated feedback, showing how this multi-faceted approach caters to diverse learning needs and enhances student development.
            
            Furthermore, I highlight the potential of AI to facilitate personalised learning experiences, fostering adaptive learning pathways that support students at different proficiency levels. Drawing on examples from English language curriculum design in higher education in Hong Kong, I illustrate how AI-driven tools can be effectively integrated into language instruction.
            
            This talk provides practical insights and strategies for educators seeking to harness AI’s potential to enhance language education, improve assessment authenticity, and support student success in an evolving academic landscape</p>
