          <h2>Call for papers</h2>
          <p>
            You are cordially invited to participate in the 19th International Conference on Blended Learning (ICBL
            2026) to be held at Peking University in Beijing, China during 28 to 31 July 2026.
            Blended learning has long been a promising approach to integrating traditional teaching with innovative
            digital means. However, the educational landscape is currently undergoing a seismic shift driven by rapid
            advancements in artificial intelligence. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and intelligent
            pedagogical agents is redefining the boundaries of what is possible in personalised education.
            ICBL 2026 seeks to explore how these cutting-edge technologies are transforming blended learning experience
            and aims to provide a premier platform for knowledge exchange and experience sharing among researchers,
            educators, and practitioners in the field. The conference theme is "Blended Learning: Innovations for Future
            Education." Original papers reporting the latest research findings and novel applications of blended
            learning are welcome. ICBL 2026 covers a broad range of topics related to blended learning including, but
            not limited to:
          <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">

            <b>Format:</b> Your paper should follow the <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" target="_blank">Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format</a>.<br /><br />
            <b>Length:</b> Submissions should be approximately 12 pages in length.<br /><br />
            <b>Publication:</b> The Conference Proceedings are planned to be published by Springer under the Lecture
            Notes in Computer Science Series (subject to confirmation).<br /><br />
            <b>Awards:</b> Best/Excellent Paper Awards will be granted to authors of papers with exceptional
            merit.<br /><br />

            <b>ISET 2026 Recommendation:</b> ICBL works closely with its sister conference, the International Symposium
            on Educational Technology (ISET).
            During the review process, the joint Program Committee may identify submissions that, while of high quality,
            are better aligned with the
            specific scope and thematic focus of ISET 2026. In such cases, authors may be invited to transfer their
            submission to ISET 2026. Authors
            accepting this recommendation will be required to revise their papers in accordance with ISET 2026
            submission requirements and must address
            the comments provided by the ICBL reviewers before final acceptance. <br /><br />
            <b>Conference Registration and Attendance:</b> To ensure the integrity of the conference program and
            proceedings, the following registration
            policies will be strictly enforced: (1) Each accepted paper must be accompanied by at least one full
            conference registration by the
            registration deadline; (2) It is mandatory for at least one author of an accepted paper to attend the
            conference in person to present
            their work; and (3) Papers that are not registered or are not presented in person during the scheduled
            session will be removed from the
            final conference proceedings. Exceptions to this policy will only be made in extreme, unforeseen
            circumstances, and require prior written
            approval from the Technical Programme Chairs.<br /><br />
