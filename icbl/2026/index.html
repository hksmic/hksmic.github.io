          <h2>Call for papers</h2>
          <p>
            You are cordially invited to participate in the 19th International Conference on Blended Learning (ICBL
            2026) to be held at Peking University in Beijing, China during 28 to 31 July 2026.
            Blended learning has long been a promising approach to integrating traditional teaching with innovative
            digital means. However, the educational landscape is currently undergoing a seismic shift driven by rapid
            advancements in artificial intelligence. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and intelligent
            pedagogical agents is redefining the boundaries of what is possible in personalised education.
            ICBL 2026 seeks to explore how these cutting-edge technologies are transforming blended learning experience
            and aims to provide a premier platform for knowledge exchange and experience sharing among researchers,
            educators, and practitioners in the field. The conference theme is “Blended Learning: Innovations for Future
            Education.” Original papers reporting the latest research findings and novel applications of blended
            learning are welcome. ICBL 2026 covers a broad range of topics related to blended learning including, but
            not limited to:
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
              <li>Adaptive Learning</li>
              <li>Application of AI in Learning</li>

          <p>
            Original papers should be written in English and submitted by 31 January 2026.<br/>

            <b>Format:</b> Your paper should follow the Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format.<br/>
            <b>Length:</b> Submissions should be approximately 12 pages in length.<br/>
            <b>Publication:</b> The Conference Proceedings are planned to be published by Springer under the Lecture Notes in Computer Science Series (subject to confirmation).<br/>

            <b>ISET 2026 Recommendation:</b> ICBL works closely with its sister conference, the International Symposium on Educational Technology (ISET).
             During the review process, the joint Program Committee may identify submissions that, while of high quality, are better aligned with the 
             specific scope and thematic focus of ISET 2026. In such cases, authors may be invited to transfer their submission to ISET 2026. Authors 
             accepting this recommendation will be required to revise their papers in accordance with ISET 2026 submission requirements and must address
              the comments provided by the ICBL reviewers before final acceptance. <br/>
            <b>Conference Registration and Attendance:</b> To ensure the integrity of the conference program and proceedings, the following registration
             policies will be strictly enforced: (1) Each accepted paper must be accompanied by at least one full conference registration by the
              registration deadline; (2) It is mandatory for at least one author of an accepted paper to attend the conference in person to present 
              their work; and (3) Papers that are not registered or are not presented in person during the scheduled session will be removed from the
               final conference proceedings. Exceptions to this policy will only be made in extreme, unforeseen circumstances, and require prior written
                approval from the Technical Programme Chairs.
