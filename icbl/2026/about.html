          <h2>About ICBL</h2>
          <p>The International Conference on Blended Learning (ICBL) is an annual international conference with the main
            focus on blended learning - an integration of the traditional learning with innovative means, such as
            e-learning and open online learning, in order to create a new learning environment to enhance learning
            effectiveness and enrich learning experience. The purpose is to bring together researchers and developers
            from
            education and computer science to advance the research of blended learning.</p>
          <p>ICBL together with its predecessors ICHL had attracted hundreds of delegates from many countries and
